# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to either remake Asteroids in pygame and add something to it, or make a vertical jumping game like an old iOS game I used to play called "Mega Jump".

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will do this project solo.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

N/A
