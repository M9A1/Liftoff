# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ben's Jumping Game (subject to change)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that resembles, Mega Jump, an old iOS game where your character has to keep boosting from coins/power ups in order to not die.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This game will hopefully be very entertaining and I hope to make it simple enough to play. You cannot win in Mega Jump technically, you can only get the highest score possible until you die, then try to improve that score later on. I will include that as well as game music/sound effects (most likely open source), sprites for objects, coins, power ups, obstacles, and characters. Lastly, this game will be executed in pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create the basic mechanics of Mega Jump, with a character that must keep their jump height in order to survive.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything mentioned in the last question as well as open-source sprites for objects and characters, scrolling background when ascending, and open-source game music/sound effects.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A good amount of different levels, scrolling background that changes depending on player's height, create my own sprite characters/animations and also my own game music.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some skills that I will need to acquire and research include becoming familiar with the pygame library and game development, controlling objects on the screen to behave how I want, and randomly generating obstacles while still making the game beatable by the player. I plan to learn from a few ways, such as reading Al Sweigart's book "Making Games with Python & Pygame" to understand how his examples in the book work, and by watching YouTube tutorials as well.
